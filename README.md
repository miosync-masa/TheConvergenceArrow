## Overview  
This repository contains Python implementations of numerical simulations and theoretical models related to the **Convergence Arrow Framework**, an innovative approach that redefines entropy growth, black hole evaporation, and quantum information flow based on **information convergence rate (λc)** instead of time dependency.

🔹 **Contributions are welcome!** If you're interested in this research, feel free to open issues, fork the repo, and submit PRs!  

🔥 **This repository is at the frontier of redefining physics through information convergence—join the revolution!** ⚔️🔥
