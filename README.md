# The Convergence Arrow - Information Convergence and Entropy Growth Simulations

## Overview  
This repository contains Python implementations of numerical simulations and theoretical models related to the **Convergence Arrow Framework**, an innovative approach that redefines entropy growth, black hole evaporation, and quantum information flow based on **information convergence rate (λc)** instead of time dependency.

## Key Contributions  
🔥 **Redefining Entropy Growth Beyond Time Dependence**  
- Reformulates entropy growth using **transaction density (ρT)** instead of time (t).  
- Derivation:  
  dS/dρT = -λc * dI(A;B)/dρT  
  where I(A;B) is the mutual information between past and future states.

🔥 **Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) Simulations**  
- Comparison of **time-dependent entropy growth models** vs. **information convergence models**  
- Numerical validation using:  
  - **Fitting Model:**  
    S(f) = S0 / (1 + λc log(1 + α f))  
  - **Gradient Analysis:**  
    dS/dλc  
  - **Second Derivative Nonlinearity:**  
    d²S/dλc²  

🔥 **Black Hole Evaporation and Page Curve Analysis**  
- Introducing λc into Hawking radiation models  
- **Modified evaporation time equation:**  
  T_evap(λc) = T_0 * exp(α λc)  
  - T_0: Standard evaporation time  
  - α: Information convergence parameter  
- Impact on **black hole information recovery** and Page curve delay  

🔥 **Unified Theory: Black Hole Information and Quantum Entanglement Decay**  
- Black hole evaporation and **entanglement collapse** follow the same information convergence dynamics:  
  dS/dλc = - S0 / (1 + λc)^2 * exp(-α λc)  
- **Key Finding:** λc ≈ 0.01 - 0.02 is the critical range where information convergence effects dominate  

## Future Work & Contributions  
📌 Validate models against real black hole observations  
📌 Extend entropy growth models to gravitational systems  
📌 Investigate deeper connections between **information convergence and the nature of time**
